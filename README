The AI Chatbot Search Engine project integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) features with Transformer-based models to provide accurate and reliable responses to health-related queries. 
Leveraging data directly from PubMed, a vast repository of biomedical literature, the chatbot offers up-to-date information on various medical topics. 
By harnessing the power of AI, users can ask questions in natural language, and the chatbot employs sophisticated algorithms to comprehend and generate contextually relevant answers.
